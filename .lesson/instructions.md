A painting company has determined that for every 113 square feet of wall space, one gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be required. The company charges $20.00 per hour for labor. Write a program that allows the user to enter the number of rooms to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon. It should also ask for the square feet of wall space in each room. The program should have methods that return the following data:


The number of gallons of paint required
The hours of labor required
The cost of the paint
The labor charges
The total cost of the paint job
Then it should display the data on the screen.
